Purpose: To make a link between front end and back end. 

---------------------------
Run the following command for reactApp:-
npx create-react-app filename 
--> This will install the react set up (and takes some time)

Run the following command for nodeJS:- 
#npx express-generator filename
#npm install 
-->command to install the packages in dependencies present in package.json file. 

#npm start 
--> starts expressJS server, defaultly on localhost: 3000
--> Ref image1, image2. 

In api(expressJS filename), under bin folder we can find www, open file and change the port number to 9000. 
? Because by default both react and express are running in the same port. 
--> Ref image3 and image4

---------------------------
ExpressJS:- filename: api 
1. In the api folder,under routes folder(ref: image5) create js file (testApi.js).
write the code in the file, link will be provided. 
2. Open app.js file. (ref: image6) and the lines 
#testAPIRouter = require('./routes/testAPI');
#app.use('/testAPI',testAPIRouter);
(ref: image7).
3. Save the files. Run following command. 
#npm start 
server now will run on port 9000. (ref: image8). Here you can find the information that you send in testApi.js file. 


---------------------------
ReactJS:- filename: client 
1. Open app.js file in src folder and write the code you can find it in the shared file. 

---------------------------
ExpressJS:- 
Enable cross origin script sharing (cors), so that we share information between client and server. 
#npm install --save cors

Add the following line in app.js file. (ref: image9)
#app.use(cors());

---------------------------
Now run the two servers simultaneously. (ref: image10)
